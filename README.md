**# Master Thesis Project: Comparison of genomic and physiological traits: _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ in the context of Atopic Dermatitis**

# Overview

This repository is to offer a supplementary data used in the master thesis project. 

# Technical Overview

Codes of test statistics and drawing plots were run through R(v. 4.0.3) and RStudio(v. 1.3.1093) in Windows 10 Pro (v. 20H2). If codes do not work, please check the version of packages on your R library and versions of packages used in this study (They are written in Material and methods section of the thesis).

# Directory structure

There are 2 directories on this repository: R codes for plots and Supplementary Tables.
1. You can check R codes of Figure 2 to 10 and data used to draw them in individual directory. Again, if any errors or part of plot do not appear, please check your "PACKAGE" version and version used in this study.

      + Figure 1A and B (Phylogenetic trees) were drawn through TYGS webtool
      
      + Figure 11 was drawn in MS Excel. You can check this in Supplementary Table 12.
  
2. In total, 12 Supplementary Tables related to this study are deposited. Details of them are below:


   - **Supplementary Table 1 :** API substrates
   - **Supplementary Table 2 :** API test reactivity
   - **Supplementary Table 3 :** Genes of S.aureus from AD patients
